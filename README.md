# GraphQL 
+ GraphQL is an open-source data query language for APIs and It is a server-side runtime for executing the query. The serverâ€™s GraphQL runtime takes care of executing the query and ensuring that the right data is fetched and sent back.

+  It is an alternative to REST, where clients make multiple requests to different endpoints to get the data they require but in GraphQL clients can request exactly the data they need in a single query.

   It was developed by Facebook and made open source for the whole world.
